# Music Genre Classification 

## Abstract
In this project, we build a system using complex operations and various features to automatically classify music genres. This project is divided into two parts. The first part involves extracting various audio features and visualizing the feature space using K-Means clustering. The second part compares different classifiers and their performances.

## I. Introduction
Classification, as a process, has been an essential method for organizing and arranging entities and objects of knowledge for future use since ancient times. Over time, classification methods have undergone various improvements and updates, especially with the advent of Big Data. Classifying such large datasets using traditional methods has become nearly impossible due to the scale of the task.

Music has long been a primary source of entertainment. A music genre can be defined as a category that recognizes the characteristics or traits of a subdivision of music belonging to an established form. Categorizing and classifying music by genre has always been a challenge.

### Music Genre Classification
Music Genre Classification involves categorizing music samples. This technique applies classification methods to musical data, distinguishing various music files based on their genres. A musical genre is represented by a label created and used by humans to categorize and describe the vast universe of music. Since there is no clear distinction between music of different genres, classifying them can be complex.

In this project, we create a system to automatically classify the music in a dataset by genre. The system consists of two parts:

1. **Feature Extraction and Visualization:**
   - Extract various features of the music and visualize them individually.
   - Organize the dataset and visualize the feature space using K-Means clustering.
   - Since music of different genres will have different feature values, we can use the feature space to understand how the music files of each genre are distributed.

2. **Classifier Comparison:**
   - Use four classifiers to automatically classify the music files by genre.
   - Test the performance of each classifier and compare them with each other.
   - The classifiers used are:
     - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Logistic Regression
     - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Industry Applications
Systems or algorithms like the one developed in this project have been used in recent years by music streaming companies such as Spotify, Deezer, and SoundCloud. These systems help maintain databases and aid in streaming, purchasing, or searching for specific music within vast datasets.
